Also, something to note as I was watching these scenes earlier, in the 2020 folder player 001 was never in there, it starts at 002. We should have all done the sus face! (Different topic I know, just love the little details)

Now we need the Back Man's front story.
Harvest the organs, eat them, I donâ€™t care.

I laughed harder than I should have when he said this.

Interesting, and fills in the whole as to why the front man tolerated the organ harvesting...

I also think it's very interesting that he lived like a pauper on the outside, because it draws a nice parallel between the front man and Gi Hun (our future antagonist and protagonist, respectively), as both seemed to ignore their newfound wealth (although maybe for quite different reasons).
